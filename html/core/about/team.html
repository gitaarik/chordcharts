            I'm a guitarist and webdeveloper from Haarlem, the Netherlands,
            and have been playing jazz and related genres for over ten
            years. Throughout this time I've played tons of songs. Along
            the way I created {{ g__settings.WEBSITE_NAME }} as a platform
            to help musicians remember their songs, learn new songs and
            collaborate better.
