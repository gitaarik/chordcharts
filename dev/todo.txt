Use Font Awesome for icons:

    http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/

    Header:
    delete: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/times/
    Key widget closed: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/caret-down/
    Key widget open: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/caret-up/
    new: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/file/ OR http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/file-o/
    edit: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/pencil/
    settings: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/cog/
    done: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/check/

    Chart:
    arrow up: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/arrow-up/
    arrow down: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/arrow-down/
    add: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/plus/

    Guitar fingerboard chord:
    note: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/circle/
    key note: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/dot-circle-o/
    Otherwise for the key note: 3 circles of different sizes on top of
    each other with the middle sized being white.

    Also close icon in popup boxes still needs to be converted (still
    using an image). Then get rid of includes/images.less.

Make it possible to change the key of a section.

Decide to use Gb Major or F# Major:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-flat_major

Complete all keys.

Make prefixes for Key, Note, ChordTypes and TimeSignature.

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Index of all charts:
    Make an index of all charts available on the website.

Search charts:
    Be able to search for charts.

How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the measures and the different chord
    symbols. Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still
    read the chord chart.

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Make a PDF export:
    So that people can easily print it out.
