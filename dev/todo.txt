Chart list:
    - When songname is so long that it covers 2 lines, the username is not
      vertically aligned in the middle.

Chart:
    - When you first change the song name, then the short description,
      it doesn't work.
    - Make the edit widgets for song name, short description and video
      and lyrics urls use a confirm or cancel button so the change
      doesn't have effect if you click cancel.
    - The half diminished symbol (0Ì¸) doesn't look good on the page.

Make things ready for alpha release:
    - Finish ansible stuff
    - Complete all keys.
    - Configure django settings for production mode

Decide to use Gb Major or F# Major:

User profile:
    - Create page where you can see all the charts of a certain user.

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Chart:
    - Remember the chosen key of a song in a cookie
    - If the chart is shown in a different key than the original, show
      the original key in the transpose widget.
    - When you try to give a chart a name like "!" we get an error
      because probably a slug can't be created with only this one
      character.
    - If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
      container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font
      size.
    - Make a PDF export, so that people can easily print it out.

Repeat section stuff:
    At "I got my love to keep me warm", the section repeating at the
    bottom is a bit weird, it would be more logical if it would just say
    "repeat 2nd A section".

Create chart:
    When typing the song name, give autocomplete suggestions.

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.
