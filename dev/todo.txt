Make things ready for alpha release:
    - Make manage.py command to make prefixes for Key, Note, ChordTypes
      and TimeSignature.
    - Finish ansible stuff
    - Complete all keys.
    - Configure django settings for production mode

Decide to use Gb Major or F# Major:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-flat_major

Footer:
    Make a nice footer, make sure there's spacing at the bottom so
    editing isn't annoying.

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Chart:
    - Remember the chosen key of a song in a cookie
    - If the chart is shown in a different key than the original, show
      the original key in the transpose widget.
    - When you try to give a chart a name like "!" we get an error
      because probably a slug can't be created with only this one
      character.
    - If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
      container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font
      size.
    - Make a PDF export, so that people can easily print it out.

Other versions:
    - Also include songs with a name that look like the original's chart
      name, ordered by best matching.

Repeat section stuff:
    At "I got my love to keep me warm", the section repeating at the
    bottom is a bit weird, it would be more logical if it would just say
    "repeat 2nd A section".

Create chart:
    When typing the song name, give autocomplete suggestions.

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.
