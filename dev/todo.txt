Add chart:

    Be able to search for charts.

Save song:
    Be able to save a song after editing.

How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the measures and the different chord
    symbols. Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still
    read the chord chart.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Zoom:
    If you use the browser zooming options, sometimes the chart gets fucked up.
