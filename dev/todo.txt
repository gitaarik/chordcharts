Update django and use new admin style:
    https://github.com/django/django/commit/35901e64b043733acd1687734274553cf994511b

Make things ready for alpha release:
    - Finish ansible stuff
    - Complete all keys (alt note notations)
    - Configure django settings for production mode

Use webpack and compass instead of gulp shite

Chart:
    - The half diminished symbol (0Ì¸) doesn't look good on some systems.

Decide to use Gb Major or F# Major:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-flat_major

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Chart:
    - Remember the chosen key when chart is transposed once.
    - If the chart is shown in a different key than the original, highlight
      the original key in the transpose widget.
    - When you try to give a chart a name like "!" we get an error because
      probably a slug can't be created with only this one character.
    - If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
      container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.
    - Make a PDF export, so that people can easily print it out.

Repeat section stuff:
    At "I got my love to keep me warm", the section repeating at the
    bottom is a bit weird, it would be more logical if it would just say
    "repeat 2nd A section".

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.
