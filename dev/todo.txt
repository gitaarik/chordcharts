Remove measure bug:
    If you have a chord that it repeated in the next measure, then remove the
    first measure, the remaining measure keeps the repeat sign, but should get
    the original notation.

Chrome border bug:
    In chrome there's a border on the colspan rows.... :(

make models smart:
    Make models use listeners to look what happens around them to see if they
    should update something. Most work is already done but some stuff I can
    think of right now are: delete model from collection (remove function in
    models/measure.js).

Add/remove section:
    Be able to add and remove a section.

Move section:
    Be able to move a section.

Set section title:
    Be able to set a section's title instead of the generated letter.

Save song:
    Be able to save a song after editing.

Add song:
    Be able to add a song.

How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the measures and the different chord
    symbols. Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still
    read the chord chart.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Optimize:
    Check what `change` events unnecessarily get triggered at startup and try
    to prevent that from happening.

Fix potential memory leaks:
    Sometimes models are being unbind but not destoyed, this could be a
    potential memory leak. Look at: `drawChords` in `views/measure.js` and
    `removeMeasure` in `views/measure_edit.js`.

Zoom:
    If you use the browser zooming options, sometimes the chart gets fucked up.
