Better initialization:
    Look into possibilities of not having to call set on backbone models, only
    set the data at model initialization, so that the 'change' won't be
    triggered on the model.

Choose chord type and bass tone:
    Make it possible to choose a chord type and a bass tone in the chord edit
    widget.

    Be able to add a box on a line.

    Be able to add a line in a section.

Save song:
    Be able to save a song after editing.

How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the boxes and the different chord symbols.
    Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still read the
    chord chart. Would also be nice to maybe have a link to a website where
    you can see how to play the chord on a certain instrument.
