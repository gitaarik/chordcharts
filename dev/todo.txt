CSS:
    - Use border-box everywhere?

Chart:
    - Use 'Escape' alongside 'Esc' JS button matching.
    - Make the enter key close the song name edit field.
    - Songname widget isn't closable through 'x' close button in widget.
    - Only allow edit when you're owner of the chart.
    - Make methods on the model `view_url()` and `edit_url()` to easily
      get the view and edit urls.
    - Make widget in sidebar to switch between different charts of the
      same song.

Make things ready for alpha release:
    - Finish ansible stuff
    - Decide to use Gb Major or F# Major:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-flat_major
    - Complete all keys.
    - Configure django settings for production mode

Repeat section stuff:
    At "I got my love to keep me warm", the section repeating at the
    bottom is a bit weird, it would be more logical if it would just say
    "repeat 2nd A section".

Make manage.py command to make prefixes for Key, Note, ChordTypes and
TimeSignature.

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Make a PDF export:
    So that people can easily print it out.
