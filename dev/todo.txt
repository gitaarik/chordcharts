Remove apply/discard buttons:
    To apply a change each time is pretty annoying, and it's not that important
    that a little mistake doesn't get saved right away. So to have a better
    user experience, remove the apply and discard buttons and just apply every
    change right away.

Change chord bug:
    If you change a chord and then without closing the edit widget click on
    another chord, that chord also changes!

    Be able to add a line in a section.

    Be able to add a section.

Move section:
    Be able to move a section.

Set section title:
    Be able to set a section's title instead of the generated letter.

    Be able to save a song after editing.

Add song:
    Be able to add a song.

How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the measures and the different chord
    symbols. Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still
    read the chord chart.

Optimize:
    Check what `change` events unnecessarily get triggered at startup and try
    to prevent that from happening.

Zoom:
    If you use the browser zooming options, sometimes the chart gets fucked up.
