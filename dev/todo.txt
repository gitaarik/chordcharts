Repeat sign:
    if you have 2 chords and change the first one to be the same as the second
    one, the second one should display a repeat sign ( % )

Bass tone:
    Currently the bass tone is not rendered in a boxpart

Better initialization:
    Look into possibilities of not having to call set on backbone models, only
    set the data at model initialization, so that the 'change' won't be
    triggered on the model.
