How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the measures and the different chord
    symbols. Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still
    read the chord chart.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Optimize:
    Check what `change` events unnecessarily get triggered at startup and try
    to prevent that from happening.

Fix potential memory leaks:
    Sometimes models are being unbind but not destoyed, this could be a
    potential memory leak. Look at: `drawChords` in `views/measure.js` and
    `removeMeasure` in `views/measure_edit.js`.

Zoom:
    If you use the browser zooming options, sometimes the chart gets fucked up.
