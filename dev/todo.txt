    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-flat_major

Complete all keys.

Make prefixes for Key, Note, ChordTypes and TimeSignature.

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Index of all charts:
    Make an index of all charts available on the website.

Search charts:
    Be able to search for charts.

How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the measures and the different chord
    symbols. Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still
    read the chord chart.

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Make a PDF export:
    So that people can easily print it out.
