Renumber objects:
    We can already remove empty children, now we should also have a
    method that makes sure the numbers of the sections/lines/measures
    are correct and there are no gaps between numbers.

Delete section should take into account the numbers:
    When you delete a section that's not the last one, the numbers of
    the following sections should be their number - 1.

Measure chords clean:
    A measure should have a method which will clean it's chords. The
    `beats` field of a chord should match the `beat_schema` of the
    measure, and chords that don't fit in the `beat_schema` should be
    removed.

Migrate to Python 3:
    - Read Django's 'Porting to Python 3':
      https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/python3/
    - Ditch South and Use Django 1.7 migrations:
      https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/
    - Use django compressor dev version:
      https://github.com/django-compressor/django-compressor/issues/458

Make rests possible:

Save song:
    Be able to save a song after editing.

Add song:
    Be able to add a song.

How to read:
    Make a how to read information popup that you can open on the page. Should
    explain things like how to read the measures and the different chord
    symbols. Would be nice if you can move it to the side so you can still
    read the chord chart.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Optimize:
    Check what `change` events unnecessarily get triggered at startup and try
    to prevent that from happening.

Fix potential memory leaks:
    Sometimes models are being unbind but not destoyed, this could be a
    potential memory leak. Look at: `drawChords` in `views/measure.js` and
    `removeMeasure` in `views/measure_edit.js`.

Zoom:
    If you use the browser zooming options, sometimes the chart gets fucked up.
