Upgrade Django to 1.8
    - Use jinja2 as template backend and make use of jinja2's features on
      places that is now ugly solved with django's template engine.

Feedback button:
    - Add a feedback button somewhere so people can give feedback on the
      platform.

Make things ready for alpha release:
    - Finish ansible stuff
    - Complete all keys.
    - Configure django settings for production mode

Gulp improvements:
    - Try to only parse the files that need to be parsed when some file
      changes, so if the file starts with an underscore, check which files
      need to be parsed for that.
    - Prevent gulp from exiting on errors

    - Use browserify's `opts.paths` option to enable absolute imports
    - Set browserify's `opts.debug` to true for sourcemaps

Chart list:
    - When songname is so long that it covers 2 lines, the username is not
      vertically aligned in the middle.

Chart:
    - The half diminished symbol (0Ì¸) doesn't look good on the page.

Decide to use Gb Major or F# Major:

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Chart:
    - Remember the chosen key when chart is transposed once.
    - If the chart is shown in a different key than the original, show
      the original key in the transpose widget.
    - When you try to give a chart a name like "!" we get an error
      because probably a slug can't be created with only this one
      character.
    - If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
      container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font
      size.
    - Make a PDF export, so that people can easily print it out.

Repeat section stuff:
    At "I got my love to keep me warm", the section repeating at the
    bottom is a bit weird, it would be more logical if it would just say
    "repeat 2nd A section".

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.
