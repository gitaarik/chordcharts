Chart:
    - When you add a new section, change the tonality from Major to
      Minor and then try to change the chord it doesn't work.
    - When you change the tonality and some chord notations change with
      that (for example from D Major to D Minor), these changes don't
      get reflected in the chord edit widget.
    - Songs don't seem to be deleted when deleting the last chart for
      a song.

Footer:
    Make a nice footer, make sure there's spacing at the bottom so
    editing isn't annoying.

Search:
    - Investigate error you get in devserver log when searching

Other versions:
    - Just use video and lyrics icon in other versions instead of the
      external link icon.

Make things ready for alpha release:
    - Finish ansible stuff
    - Decide to use Gb Major or F# Major:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-flat_major
    - Complete all keys.
    - Configure django settings for production mode

Repeat section stuff:
    At "I got my love to keep me warm", the section repeating at the
    bottom is a bit weird, it would be more logical if it would just say
    "repeat 2nd A section".

Create chart:
    When typing the song name, give autocomplete suggestions.

Chart:
    - Remember the chosen key of a song in a cookie
    - If the chart is shown in a different key than the original, show
      the original key in the transpose widget.

Make manage.py command to make prefixes for Key, Note, ChordTypes and
TimeSignature.

Make arrow-up asset in popup widget transparent.

Chord symbol list:
    A list that maps symbols to chord types, as an extention to the 'How
    to read' page.

Fit chord names:
    If the chord name is really long, sometimes it doesn't fit in it's
    container. We can probably easily fix this by adjusting the font size.

Make a PDF export:
    So that people can easily print it out.
